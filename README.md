# Open-Access Polyp Detection Platform

This repository contains all necessary code to support the paper "Assessing Clinical Efficacy of Polyp Detection Models Using Open-Access Datasets". It includes scripts for downloading, formatting, and preparing five open-access datasets utilized to create the proposed open-access platform, as well as scripts for generating ROC, event-based metrics, and FROC plots.

## Repository Structure

- **dataset_downloads**: Contains all scripts required to download, format, and prepare the five open-access datasets.
- **metrics**: Contains scripts to generate per-box and per-frame ROC, event-based metrics, and FROC plots.

Each folder contains a README file with specific instructions on how to use the scripts.
