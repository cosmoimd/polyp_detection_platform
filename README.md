# Open-Access Polyp Detection Platform

In this repository we report all the code required to download, format, and prepare the five open-access datasets used to create the open-access platform proposed in the work "Assessing Clinical Efficacy of Polyp Detection Models Using Open-Access Datasets", as well as the code to generate the ROC, event-based metric and FROC plots.
